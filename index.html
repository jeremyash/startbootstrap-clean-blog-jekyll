description: "PhD student studying global change ecology, botany and statistics"

<p> I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Botany at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  I am currently researching how the abundance and distribution of understory plant species have changed over the past 50 years, and to what degree has climate change been a driving factor.  I use a variety of statistical and modeling tools, and several large datasets to understand how species respond to environmental change over time and space.  Feel free to contact me with any shared interests or questions. <p>
