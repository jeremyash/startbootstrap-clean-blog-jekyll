    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="article-wrap">
      <p>My academic background is in ecology and environmental science, with a specific focus on quantitative plant ecology.  I am larely driven by research that uses robust quantitative methods to address ecological questions with applied conservation outcomes.    </p>

<p>With each work and research experience, I have become more interested in how to better couple the ever increasing amount of available data with statistics and predictive modeling.  For my master’s research, I combined my own field data collection with long-term demographic data to develop models that assess sustainability of leaf harvest from a palm spcies in Mexico.  For my Ph.D. research, I am integrating several existing datasets with statistical models that seek to understand recent and future ecological impacts of climate change on plant species and communities in Wisconsin.  </p>
